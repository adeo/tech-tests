Overall ADEO's UX Test

 This is a first test created for <b>UX Designers</b> willing to join Group ADEO or it's BU's. It's generic, doens't have an added value and do not address anyone of our business or projects. The goal here is to understand the technical skills of the candidate and for the candidate to understand how it is to work as UX Designer inside ADEO.
It should evolve with time and do not hesitate on leaving your feedbacks.

```hint
it's important to understand that the test might be crazy. The goal it's to understand how you work and not to evaluate the lack of sense of the test, so chill out and join the ride! : )

## How does it work?
Actually, it's quite simple. It is about a `user-story` in a way commonly used for PO's before bringing it to sprint plannings. 

#### What's expected ?
A few things, for starters would be nice to have an estimate of when you think you'll be able to deliver it and what are the steps/tasks you'll be taking. Nothing to formal and precise, it's an `estimate` for real! : )

# As a lead UX Designer, I want to see the most used interactions of our design system so that I'm instantly aware of new design needs


## Summary
Here at Adeo we're working on our new design-system. For the sake of this test, we can fake and say that our brand new design system is actually `Carbon` -> https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/overview

And thinking about that, we should be able to acomplish the user story above on their interfaces.

The main goal is to explore new interactions to make designers aware about the most used elements on the design system and how and why they are impactfull for the business.

#### A few examples of information to display: 

- <b>Overall info</b>
	- which kind of pages uses it ?
	_(home pages, landing pages, product list, product pages, checkout flows, forms and editorial pages)_

- <b>Customer Satisfaction:</b>
	- does the most loved pages have this element ?

- <b>Performance:</b>
	_- how fast does the element takes to load?_
	_- does it uses a lot of dynamic content?_
	_- % of exit (or bounce) after interacting with the element_

## The goal
Give the visibility on what are the most impactfull visual elements for our business

## Deliverable (definition of done)
- Low fidelity prototype
	_(using marvel, invision or similar... )_

- Presentation of your creation
	_(via hangout using your words and the prototype, no power point needed, pleaaaase!)_
	- what is the proposed evolution compared to what we have today?
	- Why can the proposed solution help us in our goal?
